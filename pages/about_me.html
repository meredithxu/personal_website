  <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
  <p1 class="aboutMyself">Hey, I am Yiyang Xu and I go by Meredith. I’m a third year computer science major in UCSB. I’m passionate about learning new development tools and applying those tools to solve problems that I face in my daily life and in academia. During this summer, I started to be interested in web development and I always want to have a personal website to let other people get to know me better. Therefore, I took the initiative to learn node.js, Javascript, html, and CSS to built this website!

  <br/><br/>I am also a huge basketball fan. I enjoy playing basketball with friends and watching games as well. I also love hiking and traveling. Some photos I took during my past trips can be found here. I would love to visit as many countries and national parks as I can in the future. 

  <br/><br/>Wondering if I am a good fit for your company? Here are my resume and projects</p1>
